- **EVM** (Ethereum Virtual Machine) The runtime environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Layer 2 (L2)** Scaling mechanisms that are not part of the core protocol, but utilize the root chain for security.
- **Solidity** The most fully supported programming language (of a handful of options) that can be readily compiled into bytecode for the EVM.
- **UTXO** (Unspent Transaction Output) The outputs of a blockchain transaction that are available as inputs for another transaction.
